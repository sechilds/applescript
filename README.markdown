# applescript version control

## applescript

Since I'm starting from scratch, my computer has no applescripts on it yet.
The compiled versions won't work well for version control,
so this repository (which I forked) has a Rakefile that will compile
all the applescripts and put them in the proper directory.

## install

* `git clone git://github.com/sechilds/applescript ~/applescript`
* `cd ~/applescript`
* `rake`

I think. Please don't try this yet.
