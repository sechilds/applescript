	-	New option to set start time (default: 8am)
	-	Reorganized; incorporated Rob Trew's method to get items from OmniFocus
	-	No longer fails when a Grouping divider is selected
	-	Fixes potential issue when launching from OmniFocus toolbar
	
	0.2c (2010-06-22)
	-	Actual fix for autosave
	
	0.2b (2010-06-21)
	-	Encapsulated autosave in "try" statements in case this fails
	
	0.2 (2010-06-15)
	-	Fixed Growl code
	-	Added performance optimization (thanks, Curt Clifton)
	-	Changed from LGPL to MIT license (MIT is less restrictive)
		
	0.1: Original release. (Thanks to Curt Clifton, Nanovivid, and Macfaninpdx for various pieces of code)

	
	# INSTALLATION #
	
	-	Copy to ~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Omnifocus
 	-	If desired, add to the OmniFocus toolbar using View > Customize Toolbar... within OmniFocus

	
	# KNOWN ISSUES #
	-	When the script is invoked from the OmniFocus toolbar and canceled, OmniFocus displays an alert.
		This does not occur when invoked from another launcher (script menu, FastScripts LaunchBar, etc).
