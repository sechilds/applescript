	# DESCRIPTION #
	
	This script takes the currently selected actions or projects and sets them for action this weekend.
	(If a weekend is currently in progress, the items will be set for the *current* weekend.)
	
	**IMPORTANT: The script will now always set a start date. Whether it sets a due date is up to you.
	Change this setting with the setDueDate property below.**
	
	The dates and times are set by variables, so you can modify to meet your weekend.

	# CHANGE HISTORY #
	
	0.2 (2011-07-07)
	-	Setting a due date is now optional (see settings below)
	-	No longer fails when a Grouping divider is selected
	-	Reorganized; incorporated Rob Trew's method to get items from OmniFocus
	-	Fixes potential issue when launching from OmniFocus toolbar

	0.1c (2010-06-22)
		-	Actual fix for autosave

	0.1b (2010-06-21)
		-	Encapsulated autosave in "try" statements in case this fails

	0.1: Initial release. Based on my Defer script, which incorporates bug fixes from Curt Clifton. By default, notifications are disabled (uncomment the appropriate lines to enable them).


	# INSTALLATION #

	1. Copy to ~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Omnifocus
 	2. If desired, add to the OmniFocus toolbar using View > Customize Toolbar... within OmniFocus

	# KNOWN BUGS #
	
	- When the script is invoked from the OmniFocus toolbar and canceled, OmniFocus returns an error. This issue does not occur when invoked from the script menu, a Quicksilver trigger, etc.
